    <p>The 240sx is made of 4 generations of Nissan Silvia or known as the Nissan 240sx here in the states</p>
    <p>S-Chassis is a series of cars that careers were made on. Not only that, it's even starting to become an investment.</p>
    <p>Just a few years ago, I bought a clean 1989 Nissan 240sx for about $350, now it's nearly impossible to find one for</p>
    <p>less than 5 thousand and that's for one that needs a lot of TLC. For one in great condition and depending on what motor it has </p>
    <p>I have seen in the 20k plus!! If you decide to import one good luck, they start at 15 thousand plus! </p>
    <p>It is pretty insane! These cars are a dream to drive! I have one and can vouch </p>
    <p>when I say that this car puts nothing but smiles on your face. There is a reason why this old car to this day is still</p>
    <p>used in Formula Drift. With the correct modifications, it can be the best car you have ever driven.</p>
    <p> If you manage to get one Just hold on to it for a few years or if parting out is your thing </p>
    <p>you can make your money back so easily. </p>
